Efficency - which is faster and which approach is slower
Efficiency of a code is defined by a big o notation 'O(n)'

example: O(1) = O(On+1)

n -> length of an input to your function.

Detail:
Create an output string and return a output string
this happend only once that means 2 operations: for this we can add a 2 to our efficiency.

now if number of letters are 4 and we have 3 line of code in for loop that need to run for them

then efficiency:

O(3n+2) : O(3(4)+2) 14
to calculate the efficiency you need to multiple the time that is use to run 1 line of code with 14
to get the actual efficiency.
